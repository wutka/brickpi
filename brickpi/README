This directory contains an Erlang app that controls a 2-motor robot that
uses a light sensor to follow a printed track. To use this code in other
projects you just need brickpi.erl, brickpi.hrl and the accompanying 
C executable.

To build the application, just do:
build.sh

To run it, I typically copy the ebin directory to my pi along with the
executable, then from the directory where ebin is, I just do:
erl -pa ebin

Then from Erlang:
application:start(robot).

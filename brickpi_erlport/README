This is the executable that functions as an Erlang port to give Erlang
access to the BrickPi API. You will need to install wiringPi (by default
it installs in /usr/local).

This Makefile is set up to run a cross-compiler so you can build from
a separate machine. To build directly on the Pi, change the CC = definition
to just be CC = gcc.

Then just do:
    make

You will need this executable to be somewhere in your path when you run
the Erlang application.
